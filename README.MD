# Xmas Consolidation Notes

Welcome to my Christmas Consolidation Notes! Here I've got some notes that I was asked to consolidate over a christmas break.

Since I love technology and making things look nice, I felt that using $\LaTeX$ would be a perfect fit, and so I did.

I've modified it, but the formatting is largely thanks to SeniorMars from his stuff [here](https://github.com/SeniorMars/dotfiles/tree/master/latex_template).


## TODOs
#### Maths
All of the notes lol

#### Physics
Add diagrams and examples for Mechanics.
